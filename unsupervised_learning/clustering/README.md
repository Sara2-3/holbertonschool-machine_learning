# Clustering Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores clustering algorithms in machine learning, focusing on grouping data points based on similarity without predefined labels.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.9 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- NumPy (v1.25.2) and other allowed libraries
- Code follows pycodestyle standards
- All files executable and documented

## 🚀 Implemented Methods
- K-Means Clustering – partitions data into k groups by minimizing within-cluster variance.
- Hierarchical Clustering – builds nested clusters using agglomerative or divisive strategies.
- DBSCAN – density-based clustering that discovers clusters of arbitrary shape and identifies outliers.

## 📊 Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Document and image grouping
- Anomaly detection
- Exploratory data analysis

## ✅ Key Message
Clustering helps uncover hidden structure in data by grouping similar points together, enabling better insights and downstream modeling.
