# Unsupervised Learning – Summary

Unsupervised learning is about finding hidden patterns or structure in data without labels.

The algorithm only sees inputs, not outputs.

It groups similar data points together (clustering) or reduces dimensions to highlight structure (PCA, t‑SNE).

Main goal: discover relationships and organize data when we don’t know the categories in advance.

👉 In short: unsupervised learning = learning from unlabeled data to reveal structure and similarity.
