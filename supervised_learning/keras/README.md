# Machine Learning with TensorFlow & Keras

This repository contains a series of exercises and implementations designed to build a strong foundation in machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras. The tasks progress step by step, covering essential concepts such as model building, optimization, training, validation, and saving/loading models.

The goal of this project is to provide clear, reproducible examples of how modern deep learning workflows are developed and managed in Python.

## About TensorFlow and Keras

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a flexible ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models across different platforms.

Keras is a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of creating neural networks by offering user-friendly abstractions while still allowing access to TensorFlow’s powerful backend.

Together, TensorFlow and Keras enable rapid prototyping, scalable training, and production-ready deployment of machine learning models.
