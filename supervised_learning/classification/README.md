# Binary Classification with Neuron

This project implements a simple artificial neuron in Python for binary classification tasks.  
It is part of a series of exercises exploring machine learning fundamentals using **NumPy**.

## Dataset

The project uses `.npz` datasets stored in a `data/` directory:
- `BinaryTrain.npz`
- `BinaryDev.npz`
- `MNIST.npz`

These datasets are **not uploaded to GitHub** but must be available locally for testing.
